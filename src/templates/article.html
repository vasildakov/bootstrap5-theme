    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
      The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity
      to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the
      theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics. The work
      presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and,
      despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the
      reader. The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the
      simplest and most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they
      actually originated. In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat
      myself frequently, without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of the presentation. I adhered
      scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom
      matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler. I make no pretence of having
      withheld from the reader difficulties which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have
      purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a "step-motherly" fashion, so that
      readers unfamiliar with physics may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the
      trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought!

    <h3 class="h4">Physical Meaning of Geometrical Propositions</h3>
    <p>
      In your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance with the noble building of Euclid's
      geometry, and you remember — perhaps with more respect than love — the magnificent structure, on the
      lofty staircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours by conscientious teachers. By reason
      of our past experience, you would certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the
      most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. But perhaps this feeling of proud
      certainty would leave you immediately if someone were to ask you: "What, then, do you mean by the
      assertion that these propositions are true?" Let us proceed to give this question a little
      consideration.

        <p>
          <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> (1879–1955) was a German-born physicist best known for developing
          the theory of relativity, particularly the famous equation \( E = mc² \), which describes the
          relationship between energy and mass. His groundbreaking work revolutionized physics, earning him
          the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which laid the
          foundation for quantum mechanics.
